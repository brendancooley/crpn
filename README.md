# Capability Ratios Predict Nothing

This repository contains the code for all analyses performed in ["Capability Ratios Predict Nothing,"](http://polmeth.wustl.edu/mediaDetail.php?docId=1581) a working paper by [Rob Carroll](http://www.robertjcarroll.com) and [Brenton Kenkel](http://www.bkenkel.com).

The National Material Capabilities and Militarized Interstate Disputes data we use to analyze the capability ratio and construct our alternative measure, the Dispute Outcome Expectation score, is in the `/data` subfolder.  The final estimated DOE scores and the data we use in the replication analyses are not hosted on GitHub due to file size constraints; these will be available on Dataverse soon.
